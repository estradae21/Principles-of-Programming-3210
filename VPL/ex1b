0  Here's the map between local cells and names:
0  Local cell:    Name:
0     0           n  (input value)
0     1           2  (literal)
0     2           1  (literal)
0     3           n % 2

4 4    allocate space for 4 local cells

27 0   local cell 0 <- input value (n)

22 1 2  local cell 1 <- literal 2 
22 2 1  local cell 2 <- literal 1

13 3 0 1  local cell 3 <- n % 2 (conveniently 0 or 1

8 1001 3       if n%2 is not 0 jump to 1001

0  case that n is even

   28 1     display 2 to say that n is even
   29

7 1002   hop over code for odd case

1 1001         case that n is odd

  28 2     display 1 to say that n is odd
  29

1 1002
