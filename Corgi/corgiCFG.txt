Note:  this is the draft grammar, with notes and some thoughts, 
       for the Project 2 version of Corgi
------------------

<program> -> <funcCall> | <funcCall> <funcDefs>

<funcDefs> -> <funcDef> | <funcDef> <funcDefs>

<funcDef> ->  def <var> ( ) end |
              def <var> ( ) <statements> end
              def <var> ( <params> ) end |
              def <var> ( <params> ) <statements> end

<params> -> <var> | <var> , <params>

<statements> -> <statement> | 
                <statement> <statements>

<funcCall> -> <var> ( ) |
              <var> ( <args> )

<args> -> <expr> | <expr> , <args>

<statement> ->  <string> |
                <var> = <expr> |
                <funcCall> |
                if <expr> else end |
                if <expr> else <statements> end |
                if <expr> <statements> else end |
                if <expr> <statements> else <statements> end |
                return <expr>

<expr> -> <term> | <term> + <expr> | <term> - <expr>
<term> -> <factor> | <factor> * <term> | <factor> / <term>

<factor> -> <num> | <var> |
            ( <expr> ) |
            - <factor> |
            <funcCall>


Notes:

  slightly bizarre but cool:  in Corgi you can just type a string anywhere
  as a statement and it gets sent to the console (still have to use 
  print( <expr> ) to send a number)

  no boolean type---use "non-zero is true, 0 is false"

  there's only the if-else---always have to use it

  no loop statements---use recursion!

  the built-in functions fit the grammar just like user-defined functions---
  will execute differently

  change the Lexer to remove /* ..... */ type of comments---no tokens
  produced
  
NO!  change Lexer to allow \n inside a string---put \\ in the Java string?
 This is mildly irritating, worth adding a bif:   nl()

While doing Project 2 I noticed that it's easier if we require all
functions to return (saves handling difference between hitting "end"
at the end of function that didn't do a return, and hitting "end"
elsewhere).  
So, if you want to, it's okay to assume that all functions return on all
execution paths (just do like  [return 0] if the function doesn't really
feel like returning a number.

Also, it's okay to require the initial funcCall to not be to a built-in
function (in my implementation, seems to be a problem (could probably be
easily fixed, but is a silly feature, anyway).

Here are the tentative official built-in functions:

   lt(   ,   )   returns 1 if first arg is less than             the second
                         0 otherwise
   le(   ,   )     "                       less than or equal to   "
   eq(   ,   )     "                       equal to
   ne(   ,   )     "                       not equal

   or(  ,  )    returns 1 if either arg is non-zero, 0 otherwise
   and(  ,  )   returns 1 if both args are non-zero, 0 otherwise

   not(  )   returns 1 if arg is zero, 0 otherwise

   all the original Corgi bifs (input(), sqrt, cos, sin, atan,
                                 pow( <expr>, <expr> )

   some new ones:

      print( <expr> )   just like in original Corgi, except say that if
                        the decimal part is 0, then don't display the .0
                        (this is the only bif that is called as a statement)
         NOTE:  print should ideally NOT display the decimal part if
                it is 0  --- i.e., want 37, not 37.0
      nl()    prints a newline
                (NOTE:  unlike all other functions, funcCall to print and nl
                        are statements, don't return a value)

      round( <expr> )   returns the value rounded to nearest integer
      trunc( <expr> )   returns the value with the decimal part set to 0
